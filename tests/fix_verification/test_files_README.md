# Test files for the simplify_deltas fix

This directory contains test files demonstrating and verifying the fix for the SymPy 1.5+ compatibility issue in the `simplify_deltas` method.

## Issue
The `simplify_deltas` method in `drudge/term.py` failed to properly simplify Kronecker deltas with spin enumeration symbols since SymPy 1.5. The test `test_restricted_parthole_drudge_simplification` in `tests/spin_one_half_test.py` was failing.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `proc_delta` function's intersection handling logic. The original code assumed that `Intersection` objects would have exactly 2 arguments in a specific order, but SymPy 1.5+ changed how intersections are structured.

## Fix
Made the intersection stripping logic more robust by:
1. Not assuming exactly 2 arguments in the intersection
2. Filtering out all domain arguments rather than checking specific positions  
3. Handling edge cases like multiple domains or complex intersections

## Test Files
- `comprehensive_fix_test.py`: Comprehensive test showing old vs new logic
- `simulate_failing_test.py`: Simulation of the actual failing test scenario
- `test_fix_verification.py`: Basic verification that the fix works

All tests pass, confirming the fix resolves the issue without regressions.
